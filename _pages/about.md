Hi! I'm a third-year PhD candidate in linguistics at the University of Pennsylvania. 
My research interests are in child language acquisition, especially phonological development. 
I am particularly interested in understanding how children learn discrete representations that differ from the continuous surface forms that they hear, and the role of the lexicon in this. 
I often build/use computational tools for my research.
I am advised by <a href="https://www.ling.upenn.edu/~ycharles/">Charles Yang</a>, and I am affiliated with the <a href="https://www.childlanglab.com/">Child Language Lab</a> and the <a href="https://web.sas.upenn.edu/phonetics-lab/">Penn Phonetics Lab<a/>.

Before coming to Penn, I completed my B.S. and M.Eng. in Computation and Cognition (Computer Science and Brain and Cognitive Sciences; 6-9) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
