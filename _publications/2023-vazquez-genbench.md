**Abstract:** The success of neural language models (LMs) on many technological tasks has brought about
their potential relevance as scientific theories of language despite some clear differences between LM training and child language acquisition. In this paper we argue that some of
the most prominent benchmarks for evaluating the syntactic capacities of LMs may not be
sufficiently rigorous. In particular, we show that the template-based benchmarks lack the
structural diversity commonly found in the theoretical and psychological studies of language.
When trained on small-scale data modeling child language acquisition, the LMs can be
readily matched by simple baseline models. We advocate for the use of the readily available,
carefully curated datasets that have been evaluated for gradient acceptability by large pools
of native speakers and are designed to probe the structural basis of grammar specifically. On
one such dataset, the LI-Adger dataset, LMs evaluate sentences in a way inconsistent with
human language users. We conclude with suggestions for better connecting LMs with the
empirical study of child language acquisition.
