**Abstract:** How does a multilingual speaker produce similar phonological
contrasts across the different languages that they speak? Some
theories predict crosslinguistic influence while others predict
that multilinguals keep separate sound inventories for each language. In this paper, we present crosslinguistic data from early
multilingual speakers in Malaysia. We investigate the interaction of a true voicing language (Malay), a variable voicing language (English), and an aspiration language (Mandarin). Using a random forest classification of nine acoustic correlates
of stop voicing, we show that 1) all early multilinguals show
language-specific productions of stop voicing, and 2) variation
driven by dominance can still be observed despite this language specificity. In addition, we present evidence that closure voicing
is a salient correlate alongside aspiration in Malaysian English,
and that English is more reliant on secondary correlates than
Malay and Mandarin.
