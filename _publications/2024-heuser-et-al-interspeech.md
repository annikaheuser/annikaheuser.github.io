**Abstract:** Common measures of accuracy used to assess the performance
of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems, as well as hu-
man transcribers, conflate multiple sources of error. Stylistic
differences, such as verbatim vs non-verbatim, can play a sig-
nificant role in ASR performance evaluation when differences
exist between training and test datasets. The problem is com-
pounded for speech from underrepresented varieties, where the
speech to orthography mapping is not as standardized. We cat-
egorize the kinds of stylistic differences between 6 transcrip-
tion versions, 4 human- and 2 ASR-produced, of 10 hours of
African American English (AAE) speech. Focusing on verba-
tim features and AAE morphosyntactic features, we investigate
the interactions of these categories with how well transcripts
can be compared via word error rate (WER). The results, and
overall analysis, help clarify how ASR outputs are a function of
the decisions made by the training data’s human transcribers.
