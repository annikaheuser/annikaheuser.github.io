## Course Description

Introduction to embedded systems in the context of connected devices, wearables and the "Internet of Things" (IoT). Topics include microcontrollers, energy utilization, algorithms, interfacing with sensors, networking, cryptography, and local versus distributed computation. Students design, make, and program an internet-connected wearable or handheld device. In final project, student teams design and demo their own cloud-connected IoT system.
