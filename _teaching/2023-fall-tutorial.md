## Course Description

This course has two goals. The first goal is to expose linguistics majors to primary research in linguistics. To this end, students read and discuss relevant primary sources in the linguistic literature: journal articles and book excerpts of the sort that practicing linguists use in their research. This gives students the opportunity for in-depth exposure to a range of sophisticated questions in the field. The second goal is to support linguistic majors in developing their own research, and conveying the results in a paper, conference abstract, and conference presentation.
